  Use the following information about the student journey to answer their question comprehensively and in detail.

  **Platform Overview: Ubuntu Academy**
  Ubuntu Academy is an online learning platform for Kenyan users. It features courses created and managed by an admin. Students can enroll, learn, take exams, and earn certificates.

  **The Student Journey**

  1.  **Discovery & Enrollment**:
      *   Logged-out users see public pages like Courses, About, Help, and Contact.
      *   To enroll, a user must sign up or log in.
      *   Courses can be free or paid.
      *   For paid courses, the user "pays" via a simulated M-Pesa modal. No real payment is processed. For free courses, they enroll with one click.
      *   Once enrolled, the course appears on their dashboard.

  2.  **Learning**:
      *   From their dashboard, a student clicks "Jump Back In" to go to the course player.
      *   The course player shows modules and lessons.
      *   The student watches lesson videos (if available) and reads the content.
      *   After each lesson, they click "Mark as Completed & Continue" to advance. Their progress is tracked.

  3.  **Final Exam**:
      *   Once all lessons are complete (100% progress), the Final Exam is unlocked.
      *   The student navigates to the exam page from the course player or their "My Exams" page.
      *   The exam consists of a single short-answer question. The student submits their answer.
      *   Upon submission, the exam is marked as "completed" for the student and awaits grading.

  4.  **Grading (Admin Task)**:
      *   An admin reviews the submission and grades it. This is usually done with AI assistance to ensure fairness and speed.

  5.  **Certification**:
      *   A student must score 8/10 or higher to pass the exam.
      *   If they pass, a certificate is automatically made available to them.
      *   The student can see their completed courses and a "View Certificate" button on their main dashboard.
      *   They can view the certificate and print or download it.

  **Student's Question**:
